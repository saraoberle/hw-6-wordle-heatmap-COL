Category 7: Coding out loud
Watch an episode of Coding out loud (either live or pre-recorded) and work through the project.

A few guidelines:

✅ Create a GitHub repo for your Coding out loud submission. Your repo should include

The Quarto file with all the code needed to reproduce your visualization.
A README that includes an image of your final visualization and a short summary (~ 1 paragraph) about your visualization.
✅ The final product (visualization, table, etc.) should include features or customization that are beyond what was achieved in the Coding out loud episode.

✅ Include the link to your GitHub repo in the slide summarizing your experience.
