# ggkeyboard

ggkeyboard lets you plot a keyboard and change the colours on it. This package is very experimental, so expect breaking changes as I work through making all the customization options as friendly as possible.

You can install ggkeyboard from github:

``` r 
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sharlagelfand/ggkeyboard", ref = "main")
```

# Usage

Plot a keyboard using `ggkeyboard()`. The default is very cute:

```{r pastel}
library(ggkeyboard)

ggkeyboard()
```

## Colour palettes

You can change the colours, font, sizes, etc. There are a few built in colour palettes, available via `keyboard_palette()`:

```{r palette}
library(scales)

show_col(keyboard_palette("serika"))
```

This keyboard is inspired by the [Drop + Zambumon MT3 Serika Custom Keycap Set](https://drop.com/buy/drop-zambumon-mt3-serika-custom-keycap-set):

```{r serika}
ggkeyboard(palette = keyboard_palette("serika"))
```

This one is inspired by the [Melgeek MG Wahtsy ABS Doubleshot Keycap Set](https://drop.com/buy/melgeek-mg-wahtsy-abs-doubleshot-keycap-set):

```{r wahtsy}
ggkeyboard(palette = keyboard_palette("wahtsy"))
```

and this one by the [Domikey ABS Doubleshot SA Cyberpunk Pumper Keycap Set](https://drop.com/buy/domikey-abs-doubleshot-sa-cyberpunk-pumper-keycap-set):

```{r cyberpunk}
ggkeyboard(palette = keyboard_palette("cyberpunk"))
```

## Layouts

`ggkeyboard()` defaults to using a tenkeyless keyboard, available in `tkl`:

```{r tkl}
head(tkl)
```

There is also a full keyboard layout available via `full`. This palette is based off the [Varmilo VA108 Fullsize Keyboard](https://drop.com/buy/varmilo-108-keyboard)

```{r full}
ggkeyboard(full, palette = keyboard_palette("varmilo"), font_size = 2.75)
```

a 60% layout available via `sixty_percent` (colour palette based off the [Drop + T0mb3ry SA Yuri Custom Keycap Set](https://drop.com/buy/drop-t0mb3ry-sa-yuri-custom-keycap-set)):

```{r sixty}
ggkeyboard(sixty_percent, palette = keyboard_palette("t0mb3ry"), adjust_text_colour = FALSE)
```

and a mac layout, based off the Apple magic keyboard:

```{r mac}
ggkeyboard(mac, palette = keyboard_palette("magic"))
```

You can use an ISO layout by changing `layout` to "iso", for any of the given keyboards:

```{r iso}
ggkeyboard(tkl, layout = "iso")
```

## Highlighting

You can use `highlight_keys()` to emphasize any keys - for example, to highlight what keys make up the shortcut for the pipe (%>%):

```{r highlight}
ggkeyboard(tkl) %>%
  highlight_keys(c("Alt Left", "Shift Left", "M"))
```
